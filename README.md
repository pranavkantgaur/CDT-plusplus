CDT-plusplus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pranavkantgaur/CDT-plusplus.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pranavkantgaur/CDT-plusplus)
============

**Quantize spacetime on your laptop.**

[Causal Dynamical Triangulations][1] in C++ using the
[Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][2] and [Eigen][25]>3.1.0, compiled
with [CMake][3] using [Clang][4]/[LLVM][5].
Arbitrary-precision numbers and functions by [MPFR][29] and [GMP][30].
[Docopt][19] provides a beautiful command-line interface.
[Gmock 1.7][6] may be optionally installed in order to build/run unit tests.
[Ninja][18] is a nice (but optional) replacement for `make`.
Follows (mostly) the [Google C++ Style Guide][7], which
you can check by downloading and running the [cpplint.py][8] script:

~~~
# python cpplint.py <filename>

Prerequisites:
------

CDT++ should build on any system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) with
[CMake][14], [CGAL][15], and [Eigen][25] installed. [Gmock][6] is optional
for running the unit tests, and [Ninja][18] is an optional replacement for
`make` which provides quick parallel builds of the unit tests.

On MacOS, the easiest way to do this is with [HomeBrew][16]:

~~~
# brew install cmake
# brew install eigen
# brew install cgal --imaging --with-eigen3 --with-lapack
# brew install ninja
~~~

On Ubuntu, you can do this via:
~~~
# sudo apt-get install cmake
# sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
# sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
# sudo apt-get install ninja-build
~~~

Build:
------
This project uses a separate build directory, which allows you to rebuild the
project without cluttering the source code. Thus, download this source code
(clone this repo from GitHub or grab a zipped archive [here][17]) and run the
following commands in the top-level directory:

~~~
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make
~~~

(Or run [build.sh][27]) if you have [Ninja][18] installed.

This should result in the main program executable, `cdt` in the build directory.

If you have GMock installed and set `GMOCK_TESTS` to **TRUE** (which is the
default), the unit test executable, `unittests`, will also be present. See the
section on Tests for details.

If you are not interested in the unit tests and only want to run the program,
set `GMOCK_TESTS` in [CMakeLists.txt][28] to **FALSE**.

For some versions of Linux, you may have to build CGAL from source.
Follow the instructions (or their equivalent) given in the install section
of the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/blob/master/.travis.yml) buildfile.

There are enough unit tests that it's worthwhile doing fast parallel builds.
[Ninja][18] is just the ticket. It's effectively a drop-in replacement for
`make`, and works nicely because CMake generates the build files.
There's quite a difference in speed.

Basically, everywhere you see `make` you can type `ninja` instead. Again, see
[build.sh][27] for an example.

Usage:
------
CDT-plusplus uses [docopt][19] to parse options from the help message, and so
understands long or short argument formats, provided the short argument given
is an unambigous match to a longer one. The help message should be instructive:

~~~
# ./cdt --help
Causal Dynamical Triangulations in C++ using CGAL.

Copyright (c) 2014 Adam Getchell

A program that generates d-dimensional triangulated spacetimes
with a defined causal structure and evolves them according
to the Metropolis algorithm. Specify the number of passes to control
how much evolution is desired. Each pass attempts a number of ergodic
moves equal to the number of simplices in the simulation.

Usage:./cdt (--spherical | --toroidal) -n SIMPLICES -t TIMESLICES [-d DIM] -k K --alpha ALPHA --lambda LAMBDA [-p PASSES]

Examples:
./cdt --spherical -n 64000 -t 256 --alpha 1.1 -k 2.2 --lambda 3.3 --passes 1000
./cdt --s -n64000 -t256 -a1.1 -k2.2 -l3.3 -p1000

Options:
  -h --help             Show this message
  --version             Show program version
  -n SIMPLICES          Approximate number of simplices
  -t TIMESLICES         Number of timeslices
  -d DIM                Dimensionality [default: 3]
  -a --alpha ALPHA      Negative squared geodesic length of 1-d timelike edges
  -k K                  K = 1/(8*pi*G_newton)
  -l --lambda LAMBDA    K * Cosmological constant
  -p --passes PASSES    Number of passes [default: 10000]
~~~

The dimensionality of the spacetime is such that each slice of spacetime is
`d-1`-dimensional, so setting `d=3` generates 2 spacelike dimensions and one
timelike dimension, with a defined global time foliation. Thus a
`d`-dimensional simplex will have some `d-1` sub-simplices that are purely
spacelike (all on the same timeslice) as well as some that are timelike
(span two timeslices). In [CDT][1] we actually care more about the timelike
links (in 2+1 spacetime) and the timelike faces (in 3+1 spacetime).

Documentation:
--------------

If you have Doxygen installed you can simply type (at the top level directory,
Doxygen will recursively search):

~~~
# doxygen
~~~

This will generate **html/** and **latex/** directories which will contain
documentation generated from CDT++ source files. `USE_MATHJAX` has been enabled
in [Doxyfile](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/blob/master/Doxyfile)
so that the LaTeX formulae can be rendered in the html documentation using
[MathJax][20]. `HAVE_DOT` is set to **YES** which allows various graphs to be
autogenerated by Doxygen using [GraphViz][21]. If you do not have GraphViz
installed, set this option to **NO**.

Tests:
-----------
[GMock][6] is optional, but strongly recommended if you want to make changes to
or understand the source code in detail. Building the [GMock][6] `unittests`
executable is set by the `GMOCK_TESTS` variable in [CMakeLists.txt][28].

To install Gmock, look at the [README][24]. Ubuntu users can just do:

~~~
# sudo apt-get install google-mock
~~~

But you may run into trouble because Gmock is the wrong version, or has the
wrong compiler flags. I just download and build gmock-1.7 in a local directory.

You should also have the following environment variables set:

~~~
export GMOCK_HOME="$HOME/gmock-1.7.0"
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$GMOCK_HOME/lib/.libs:$GMOCK_HOME/gtest/lib/.libs:/usr/local/lib:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
~~~
(Or wherever you built GMOCK and your dynamic libraries for CGAL.)


Unit tests using GMock are then run (in the build directory) via:

~~~
# ./unittests
~~~

You can build and run validation tests by typing:

~~~
# make test
~~~

Or, if you are using Ninja:

~~~
# ninja test
~~~

In addition to the command line output, you can see detailed results in the
build/Testing directory which is generated thereby.

Static Analysis:
-----------
Clang comes with [scan-build][32] which can run static analysis integrated with
CMake and Ninja. Simply run the [scan-build.sh][33] script. Note that this
script is somewhat fragile, as it depends upon the version of llvm installed,
as it links directly to those directories without helpful symlinks to abstract
version numbers away.
